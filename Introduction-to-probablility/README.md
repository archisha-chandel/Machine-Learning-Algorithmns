<h1>Project Overview
</h1>
For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.
What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?
